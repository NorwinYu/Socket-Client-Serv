This article explores ways in which virtual 
environments can be used for crowdsourcing and 
behavior mining for filling gaps within the information
space of topical research. Behavior mining 
in this article refers to the act of 
harvesting the latent or instinctive
behavior of participants, usually
a crowd, and injecting the population behavior 
into a pre-set context, such as within a virtual 
environment so that the subjective 
behaviors and the contexts are merged. 
The experimental approach 
combines various modalities centered upon
virtual environments so as to induce presence in order 
to bring participants into the context.
This approach is new and not well studied,
however, it has real potentials in research dealing
with behaviors and culture in reconstructed 
virtual environments. Two virtual environments
case studies at the 2012 and 2015 Royal Society
Summer Science Exhibition were presented, which
demonstrated that the unique crowdsourcing
activity is able to fill up gaps within
the information space so that answers 
to research questions can be more complete.
Thus, by reconstructing and replicating 
a lost landscape, and by injecting harvested 
human behavior into the context of the 
landscape, we may be able to gather much
more information than conventional methods
will allow.
